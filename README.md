# Labeled Faces in the Wild Home (LFW)

This dataset was originally downloaded from University of Massachusetts Amherst (Gary B. Huang, Marwan Mattar, Honglak Lee, and Erik Learned-Miller. Learning to Align from Scratch. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2012) then organized into separated directories refering to 19 celebrities with more than 40 samples.

The goal of this repository is to facilitate the teaching of deep learning classes with organized data.

Please, refer the full dataset at [LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/).

This dataset was adapted to use in Machine Learning classes. The generated output image removed and the directory structure was changed.
